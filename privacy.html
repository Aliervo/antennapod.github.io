    <h2>Which kind of information do we process?</h2>
    <p>
      All information provided to AntennaPod is only stored locally in your device. AntennaPod does not upload your information anywhere. The developers of AntennaPod do not have access to any of your information. The information is not shared with any 3rd parties. AntennaPod does not include any advertisement libraries or any 3rd party tracking (analytics) code, such as Google Analytics. AntennaPod is therefore fully compliant with the GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
      When synchronizing with gpodder.net, the service can use all your subscriptions and playback events. They handle your data according to their <a href="https://gpodder.net/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. Synchronization is disabled by default.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>

    <p>
      The app requests the following privacy-relevant Android permissions:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Read from/write to Storage (Photos/Media/Files)</strong><br />
        The storage permission is used to open files that are not downloaded directly from within the app. It can also be used to import app settings or opml files. The permission is only requested if you perform an action that requires reading from storage.</li>
        <li><strong>View WiFi connections</strong><br />
        AntennaPod allows to restrict automatic updates to specific WiFi networks.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
      
    <h2>Side channels</h2>
    <p>
      If you have activated <em>backup &amp; reset</em> in your phone settings (<em>Settings</em> → <em>Backup & Reset</em> → <em>Back up my data</em>), you should be aware that Android itself will periodically save a copy of your phone's data in Google's servers. This backup contains private information, including your WiFi passwords, messages and call history. It may also include data from AntennaPod and from other apps you use. The developers of AntennaPod do not have access to this data.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web servers that provide the podcast feeds might collect additional data, such as remote IP, access time and what is being accessed. This includes the fact which episodes you are downloading or streaming. Please refer to their privacy policy for details. You can view the url of a podcast by opening the podcast and pressing the info icon. AntennaPod does not allow remote servers to set cookies. The servers can detect the fact that you are using AntennaPod and which version of AntennaPod you are using (HTTP <em>User-Agent</em>). If multiple podcasts are hosted on the same server, the server can detect the list of podcasts that you subscribed to and that are hosted on that server. This might happen if publishers use feedburner, podtrac or similar services to distribute their feeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using the search feature of iTunes, fyyd or gpodder.net, those services can store your query. After subscribing, the feed is usually served from the creator's server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The developers may update this policy in the future. It is advisable to check the policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are made on this document.
